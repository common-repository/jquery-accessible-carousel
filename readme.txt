JQuery Accessible Carousel is a WAI-ARIA Enabled Carousel Plugin for Wordpress

== Description ==

JQuery Accessible Carousel is an carousel of the images in folder
"wp-content/plugins/JQueryAccessibleCarousel/lib/images" and uses the JQuery WAI-ARIA enabled carousel.
All images (.jpg or .png or .gif) in the "wp-content/plugins/JQueryAccessibleCarousel/lib/images" folder
are first resized to 150x150 px in order to be used by the plugin. Each image's file name is used as the
image's alt text (underscores "_" are replaced by spaces " "). For example if the image's filename is
"This_is_the_company_logo.png" then the alternative text will be alt="This is the company logo".
